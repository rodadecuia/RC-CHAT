title: "API Introduction"

Welcome to the RC-CHAT API documentation. Our API allows you to interact with the RC-CHAT platform programmatically, enabling you to manage contacts, tickets, messages, and more.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the following base URL:

```
https://your-domain.com/api
```

## Authentication

All requests to the RC-CHAT API must be authenticated. We use a Bearer Token authentication scheme.

You need to include an `Authorization` header in all your requests with a valid API token.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

You can generate and manage your API tokens from the user profile section within the RC-CHAT application.

### Example Authenticated Request

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://your-domain.com/api/contacts' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

## Common Concepts

### Pagination

Endpoints that return a list of items (like listing contacts or tickets) are paginated. You can control the pagination using the following query parameters:

- `pageNumber`: The page you want to retrieve. Defaults to `1`.

The response for a paginated endpoint will typically include the following fields:
- `count`: The total number of items available.
- `hasMore`: A boolean indicating if there are more pages of results.

### Error Responses

If a request fails, the API will return a standard error response in JSON format with an appropriate HTTP status code.

**Example Error Response (404 Not Found):**

```json
{
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Resource not found."
}
```
